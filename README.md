# PWM-Controlled-Center-of-Mass-Balancing-System
Engineered a real-time object balancing system using PWM-controlled motors and ultrasonic sensors to detect tilt via ground distance. Integrated an adaptive feedback algorithm that iteratively refines motor movements to maintain precise balance. Achieved smooth stabilization by minimizing overshoot and reacting dynamically to weight shifts.
